# Smartplug
WiFi controller for home automation

## Description
A smartplug is a device with which you can control the conection of an appliance remotely. As of version 2, I'm using an ESP8266 micro-controller, and controlling it using MQTT.

The schematics are publicly available in this repository, and the fabrication files are available in the releases page. All the required codes are also publicly available here, though you'll have to setup your Arduino IDE to program the MCU. Refer to the [libraries guide](./LIBRARIES_GUIDE.md) to learn how to do it.
